# PDF--Metadata-Editor
PDF Metadata Editor &amp; file storage

This is a simple web app built in PHP. No database setup required.

The app asks for a PDF file upload and loads its meta data in a form. 

Form data is editable allowing to save the updated PDF in the app's storage (Uploads folder).

Any uploads will be visible on the home screen and are clickable/ downloadable files.

NOTE: When uploading the files to the server you may need to change the Uploads folder permissions to 755.
